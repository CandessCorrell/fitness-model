Based on an assessment ID
I want to get the scores of all answers associated with a single assessment and aggregate each of them by category

Aggregate each category by assessment id and return a total score.

Return all of these scores as final response to frontend.

TABLES
answers, questions, assessments

score is in answer
category is related by question and assessment_id is also related by question

LOGIC FLOW
JOIN assessments on questions by assessment_id. Then JOIN on answers by question_id. Given an assessment id, return all questions associated with that assessment_id

Then aggregate "score" based on category_id

SQL Syntax
SELECT q.category_id, SUM(ans.score) FROM questions as q INNER JOIN answers as ans ON 
q.question_id=ans.question_id WHERE q.assessment_id={0} GROUP BY q.category_id
